As a user, I should be able to choose a difficulty level.  For instance at an easier level you get feedback as you guess as to whether or not you are on the right track.  So if you select the wrong section the drop down box has a red glow around it.

As a user, I can play this game with a friend where we both have separate dropdown menus to make our guesses.
